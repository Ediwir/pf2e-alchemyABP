# PF2e Alchemy for ABP

In the current state, the ABP variant disables all item bonuses and adds stacking damage dice to all weapons. This removes any usability from almost all alchemical items and increases bomb damage by two to three times at most levels, with the first element being likely undesirable by players and the second likely unwelcome by GMs.

Alchemy for ABP adds a compendium of reworked alchemical items built to overlap (but not stack) with the bonuses granted by the official ABP implementation. The compendium is available under the name "alchemy for ABP" and includes only the affected items, which are all the items that grant numerical bonuses. Unaffected items, such as smokesticks or cat's eye elixirs, should still be used in their base version.

The compendium does not, as of this version, include bombs, as their reimplementation proved too difficult. I do encourage anyone able to help to contact me on the foundry discord.
