# PF2e Alchemy for ABP - discontinued
-------------------------------------
The module is no longer being updated. Instead, I recommend PF2e ARP (Automatic Runic Progression) by reonZ.
-------------------------------------

In the current state, the ABP variant disables all item bonuses and adds stacking damage dice to all weapons. This removes any usability from almost all alchemical items and increases bomb damage by two to three times at most levels, with the first element being likely undesirable by players and the second likely unwelcome by GMs.

Alchemy for ABP adds a compendium of reworked alchemical items built to overlap (but not stack) with the bonuses granted by the official ABP implementation. The compendium is available under the name "alchemy ABP items" and includes only the affected items, which are all the items that grant numerical bonuses. Unaffected items, such as smokesticks or cat's eye elixirs, should still be used in their base version.

Another compendium, "alchemy ABP bombs", includes bombs made to circumvent ABP so that the only applied damage will be the bomb's original damage. ABP will still (despite various attempts) add a small amount of damage (from +1 to +4), but will no longer double the original damage. All bombs are included.

The compendium does not, as of this version, fix bombs attack bonuses. It also does not (and will not) include drugs.
